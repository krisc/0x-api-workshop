# 0x API Workshop

## Requirements

- Ensure you have node 8 or above.  If you don't, I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple node versions
- Ensure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed

## Running

- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- `cp .env.example .env` and replace variables with your own
- Ensure you have enough of the Kovan assets specified in `index.ts` to make the trade
- Run `yarn dev`
